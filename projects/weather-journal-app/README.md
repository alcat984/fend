# Weather Journal App
This project is intended to build a Weather Journal app adopting an asynchronous web app approach consuming a web API to dynamically update the UI.

I'll be using [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) wich is one of the leading digital weather information providers.

The web app will update the UI calling the API and fetching the weather information requested by the end user.

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

# Instructions
This will require modifying the server.js file and the website/app.js file. You can see index.html for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use style.css to style your application to customized perfection.

# Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use tests.js as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
